# Sending Transactions

## <mark style="background-color:green;">Depositing Funds</mark>

Send tokens to the privacy pool

```typescript
async deposit(
    amountGwei: bigint,
    signatureCallback: (request: SignatureRequest) => Promise<string>,
    fromAddress: string,
    relayerFee?: RelayerFee,
    blockNumber?: number,
): Promise<string>
```

* [directDeposit(type, fromAddress, amount, sendTxCallback)](direct-deposits.md#sending-direct-deposit)
* [depositEphemeral(amount, ephemeralIndex, relayerFee)](ephemeral-deposits.md#sending-ephemeral-deposits)
* [getLimits(address, directRequest)](../account-less-mode-operations/transaction-constraints.md#getting-pool-limits)

</details>

### Parameters

`amountGwei` - token amount to deposit into an account (in pool dimension)

`signatureCallback` - a callback with [SignatureRequest](../common-types.md#signature-request) which invoked when needed to ask user to sign data

{% hint style="info" %}
The signature request type depends on deposit scheme which set in the pool configuration during library init. Currently all deployments use `SignatureType.TypedDataV4` signature
{% endhint %}

`fromAddress` - the `0x`-address which will be used to depositing funds

`relayerFee` - a raw [relayer fee object](../common-types.md#relayer-raw-fee) which will be used to estimate total transaction fee (will requested under the hood when undefined)

`blockNumber` - the client waits until the internal provider becomes synced with the specified block before the input account balance (and allowance if applicable) validation. The waiting interval is hardcoded to 60 seconds. If the provider does not become synced within that interval the transaction is sent.

### Returns

`Promise` returns `jobId` returned by relayer which can be use to monitor transaction

### Example

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript"><strong>const jobId = await zkClient.depositPermittable(
</strong>      100000000000n, // 100 BOB in pool dimension
      async (signingRequest) => {
          switch (signingRequest.type) {
          case SignatureType.TypedDataV4:
              // signingRequest.data is an object for typed signature
              // which contains domain, types, primaryType and message fields
              return signTypedData(signingRequest.data); // use a 3rd-party lib to sign
          case SignatureType.PersonalSign:
              // signingRequest.data is hex-string representation of signing data
              return sign(signingRequest.data); // use a 3rd-party lib to sign
          default:
              throw new Error(`Signing request with unknown type`);
          }
      },
      '0x49C92c016d2c7A245aAF5351BD932D9D61536eC0',    // depositor address
      undefined    // the actual relayer fee will be requested under the hood
   );
console.log(`Deposit sent to the relayer. A job with ID ${jobId} has been assigned`)
// output: Deposit sent to the relayer. A job with ID 42 has been assigned
</code></pre>

## <mark style="background-color:green;">Transfer Funds Inside a Pool</mark>

Transfer tokens inside a pool to the requested addresses. The function creates a set of transactions (needed to process requests), sends it to the relayer in sequence order and returns a set of job IDs assigned by relayer

```typescript
async transferMulti(
    transfers: TransferRequest[],
    relayerFee?: RelayerFee
): Promise<string[]>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This routine may produce several transactions in rare cases when you have a lot of unspent notes. It can increase overall fee needed for transferring requested funds amount. Please refer to the examples described [here](../../../zkbob-overview/fees/unspent-note-handling.md) to better understanding notes aggregation flow
{% endhint %}

### Parameters

`transfers` - a set of transfer destinations. A single destination should contain the receiver shielded address and associated funds amount to transfer

{% hint style="info" %}
Please keep in mind the single transaction can include up to 127 output notes, i.e. if your request contains more than 127 destination addresses additional transactions can be created
{% endhint %}

`relayerFee` - a raw [relayer fee object](../common-types.md#relayer-raw-fee) which will be used to estimate total transaction fee (will requested under the hood when undefined)

### Returns

`Promise` returns array of job IDs (each sent transaction associated with the unique job ID assigned by relayer)

### Example

```typescript
transfers = [{
   // Alice will receives 15 BOB
   destination: zkbob_sepolia:CFSGGVWQpmwxmHEiZ123PXKVxbpv3LthegaSiwS1RKW1o5ExL3zRSRTg3TR9sHF,
   amountGwei: 15000000000n
}, {
   // Bob will receive 42 BOB
   destination: zkbob_sepolia:ELg4LcwsynhEaZWh9SNgWBbK7Xg2tjVyTNCgaxvoy4c7jLNudcJqAdL459RHBdg
   amountGwei: 42000000000n
}];
const jobIds = await zkClient.transferMulti(transfers);
console.log(`Accepted by relayer. Job(s) ${jobIds.join(', ')} created`)
// output: Accepted by relayer. Job(s) 43 created
```

## <mark style="background-color:green;">Withdraw Funds From the Pool</mark>

Withdraw tokens to the `0x`-address. The function creates a set of transactions (needed to process withdraw), sends it to the relayer and returns a set of job IDs assigned by relayer

```typescript
async withdrawMulti(
    address: string,
    amountGwei: bigint,
    swapAmount: bigint,
    relayerFee?: RelayerFee
): Promise<string[]>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This routine may produce several transactions in rare cases when you have a lot of unspent notes. It can increase overall fee needed for the funds withdrawal. Please refer to the examples described [here](../../../zkbob-overview/fees/unspent-note-handling.md) to better understanding notes aggregation flow
{% endhint %}

* [getLimits(address, directRequest)](../account-less-mode-operations/transaction-constraints.md#getting-pool-limits)
* [maxSupportedTokenSwap()](../account-less-mode-operations/transaction-constraints.md#maximum-supported-token-swap-during-withdraw)

</details>

### Parameters

`address` - a `0x` destination address to the sending withdrawn tokens

`amountGwei` - tokens amount to be withdrawn (in pool dimension)

`swapAmount` - part of `amountGwei` which requested to swap to the native coins on withdrawal (in pool dimension)

{% hint style="info" %}
Swap ability doesn't supported on the each pool. Use method [maxSupportedTokenSwap](../account-less-mode-operations/transaction-constraints.md#maximum-supported-token-swap-during-withdraw) to request how many tokens you can swap on the waithdrawal transaction&#x20;
{% endhint %}

`relayerFee` - a raw [relayer fee object](../common-types.md#relayer-raw-fee) which will be used to estimate total transaction fee (will requested under the hood when undefined)

### Returns

`Promise` returns array of job IDs (each sent transaction associated with the unique job ID assigned by relayer)

### Example

```typescript
const jobIds = await zkClient.withdrawMulti(
    '0x09d967A5268b64E8334f3a65336C33B7538BFe69',
    25000000000n, // withdraw 25 BOB
    5000000000n,  // swap 5 (of 25 BOB) to MATIC
);
console.log(`Accepted by relayer. Job(s) ${jobIds.join(', ')} created`)
// output: Accepted by relayer. Job(s) 44 created
```
