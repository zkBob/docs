# zkBob Merkle Tree

![Full Merkle tree](../../.gitbook/assets/Merkle\_200dpi\_b.png)

The merkle tree in the zkBob solution is used to link and store encrypted transaction data (accounts and notes) within a strict sequence. The accounts and note hashes are placed in the tree leaves.

The Merkle tree leaves and nodes contain hashes. Each node is calculated as a hash of two child nodes. Each leaf depends on its type (account and note leaves). The [Poseidon](the-poseidon-hash.md) function is used to calculate hashes with the appropriate parameters.

The full Merkle tree can be divided into a transaction subtree and a commitment subtree (with transaction commitments as leaves).

The commitment subtree ensures the correct transaction sequence without transaction data processing.

The transaction subtree links underlying data (accounts and notes) within a single operation. The transaction subtree's root is called the "transaction commitment." The commitments are using as commitment subtree leaves. Each transaction subtree is building with the corresponding [memo block](../transaction-overview/untitled-1/).

#### Merkle tree height

Please keep in mind that the tree in the picture above is not on its actual height. It's just a simple representation.

The zkBob solution uses a Merkle tree with a total height of 48 (transaction subtree with the height of 7 and commitment subtree with the height of 41).

Due to this the height transaction supports up to 128 leaves (a single account plus 127 notes) and tree supports up to $$2^{41} \approx 2.2 * 10^{12}$$ transactions
{% endhint %}

According to the scheme above, a new transaction determines a new transaction subtree which will be added to the full Merkle tree. Adding a new transaction will affect the Merkle tree root. So the Merkle tree root determines a current tree state.

The pool contract holds the current leaves count (the number of transactions multiplied by 128) and the Merkle tree roots for all transactions.
