## About

[zkBob](https://app.zkbob.com) is a stablecoin-based privacy application deployed on Polygon and Optimism and designed for everyday users and [common use cases](zkbob-overview/basic-concepts/use-cases/). zkBob uses [zkSNARKS](implementation/zksnarks-and-circuits/) to anonymize senders, receivers, and amounts when transferring stable funds. [Compliance features](zkbob-overview/compliance-and-security/) deter bad actors and illicit usage, giving privacy and safety back to ordinary blockchain users.&#x20;

zkBob was originally developed for use with the [BOB token](zkbob-overview/bob-stablecoin.md), a multi-chain stable token (stablecoin). Now zkBob now supports multiple tokens, **including USDC on Polygon and ETH on Optimism**. Once tokens are deposited into the zkBob pool, participants can transfer any amount\* amongst themselves in a private, secure manner without needing to connect MetaMask, WalletConnect or any web3 wallet.

When a transfer is initiated, the amount and recipient is never disclosed or published. Transactions are routed through a [relayer](implementation/relayer-node/), abstracting gas fees while providing an efficient transfer environment.&#x20;

Deposits, transfers and withdrawals are all processed on Polygon or Optimism, with standardized gas fees ($0.10 per tx on MATIC, variable on Optimism) paid using the supported token.

* The [zkBob application](https://app.zkbob.com/) is multichain (**Polygon & Optimism**) to utilize existing infrastructure (Uniswap v3, Aave, and native USDC), prioritize scalability, and support their commitment to zk-based solutions.

_\*zkBob introduces_ [_deposit and withdrawal limits_](zkbob-overview/deposit-and-withdrawal-limits.md) _and other_ [_compliance features_](zkbob-overview/compliance-and-security/) _to keep the application and its users safe. Transfers are limited by these pool constraints._&#x20;
