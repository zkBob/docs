# BOB Highlights

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB is a multi-chain & multi-collateral stable token (stablecoin) enhanced with optional privacy features.

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB is acquired through swaps using apps like [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/137/unified/swap/USDC/BOB), [Uniswap v3,](get-bob-on-uniswap-v3.md) [Metamask,](swap-bob-with-metamask-swap.md) [Kyberswap](https://kyberswap.com/swap/bnb/bob-to-busd), [Paraswap](https://app.paraswap.io/) and others. BOB can also be transferred between users in a shielded form using the zkBOB application.

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB inventory is currently available on Polygon, Optimism, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain. Additional chains may be added in the future to support multi-chain deposits and withdrawals.

:heavy\_check\_mark:  BOB is optimized for zkBob. Once deposited, BOB can be sent privately between participants in the zkpool. Transfers are done completely within the application - there is no need to use or connect MetaMask, WalletConnect, or any other web3 wallet to conduct private transfers and you only need BOB, there is no additional fee token.

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB will be used to explore new mechanics for privacy, governance, and value capture for stablecoin users, such as redistribution of lost funds, compounding yield refunds, and other features.&#x20;
