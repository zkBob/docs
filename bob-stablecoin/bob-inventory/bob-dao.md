# BOB DAO

As the BOB stablecoin continues to gain traction a larger DAO is in early-stage formation. This DAO will be tasked with operations management and overseeing processes that require thoughtful deliberation. Since the protocol is upgradeable, there is a need for an overarching and distributed governing body. All protocol management entities (Phase 1 and Phase 2) agree to uphold the following duties:

### **BOB Governance Fiduciary Duties**&#x20;

* Responsibility for the well-being of the organization and its assets.
* Responsibility to act in the best interests of the organization above one's personal interests.
* Responsibility to follow all regulations, rules, and guidelines.

### **Beta Phase 1**

In the beta phase a 3/6 multisig SAFE is tasked with protocol management. This SAFE is composed of members of the zkBob team and the [Blockscout](https://docs.blockscout.com/) team. These teams have experience and an excellent track record with the xDai chain (now [Gnosis Chain](https://docs.gnosischain.com/)) and TokenBridge managing 200M+ in assets. This small multisig provides the ability to iterate quickly and immediately fix time-sensitive problems that arise during beta.&#x20;

### **Post-Beta Phase 2**&#x20;

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) will be established to oversee important operations such as upgradeability, BOB minting, CDP management, timelocks, and other critical protocol decisions. Criteria for membership in the DAO is currently in review to ensure a dedicated and diverse group of projects and individuals from across the BOB ecosystem is included.\
