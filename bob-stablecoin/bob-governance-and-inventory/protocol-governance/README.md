# Protocol Governance

During beta phase 1 a 3/6 multisig SAFE manages protocol upgrades and risk assessment. This threshold was officially established with GP 0. Protocol updates are handled through the SAFE. For more info on governance see the [BOB DAO](../bob-dao.md) page.&#x20;

* The Governance SAFE address is [0xd4a3D9Ca00fa1fD8833D560F9217458E61c446d8](https://app.safe.global/matic:0xd4a3D9Ca00fa1fD8833D560F9217458E61c446d8/home)

In addition to [inventory management](../inventory-management/), the beta governance team also proposes and completes protocol updates. Details regarding specific updates are linked below.
