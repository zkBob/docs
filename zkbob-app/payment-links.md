# Payment links

Now you can create a link that can be further distributed for the sake of receiving donations or other payments. All this happens through ZkBob, thanks to which your privacy is preserved...

First you need to switch to Polygon USDC ZkBob from above:

We can copy or share. I follow the link to show you how everything works:

We confirm in the wallet and that's it:

We go to History and see what has been received. The balance will be updated in the near future:
