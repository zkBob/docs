# Support ID

Due to the anonymous nature of transactions within the zkBob pool, it is difficult to troubleshoot and resolve issues surrounding any failed transactions. Errors within the application can then result in lost funds for users who cannot be identified.&#x20;

To remedy this, we issue a session-based Support ID. A unique Support ID is created  and sent to the relayer along with any actions completed during a single session. The support team can then follow the transaction thread to determine where and why the error occurred and help users recover funds when appropriate.&#x20;
