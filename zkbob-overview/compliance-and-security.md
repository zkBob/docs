**Prior to using zkBob, a user must acknowledge and accept the following terms:**

* If acting as an individual you are of legal age (as applicable in the jurisdiction where you live).
* You are not a politically exposed person, that is, a person who is entrusted with any prominent public function, or a politically exposed person who has stepped down from that role.

* zkBob contributors are not responsible for any losses or damages associated with inherent risks associated with cryptography, blockchain, or digital wallet usage.
* The user agrees not to access zkBob using any technology for the purposes of circumventing geo restrictions (ie VPN).
* Users are responsible for reporting and paying any applicable taxes associated with usage.
* Users acknowledge that addresses may be blocked from using the protocol if they are sanctioned or added to a block list.

## Daily limits

Limits are imposed to prevent large-scale transactions which may be the result of illicit activity. [Deposit limits are detailed here](deposit-and-withdrawal-limits.md).

## Security

### Beta Release

zkBob is now released in a beta version. Not all contracts have been audited (zkpool contracts have been audited) and users should use at their own discretion. Risks to users are mitigated through [limits on deposits and withdrawals](deposit-and-withdrawal-limits.md). In addition, the overall size of a pool cannot exceed 1,000,000 BOB tokens.

### Bug Bounty

Bounties are one of the most important tools for testing and enhancing application and contract security. We are in the planning phases to implement a bug bounty to help protect users and their funds.
