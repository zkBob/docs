# Use Cases

zkBob can be used to protect transactional privacy for a variety of use cases. Businesses, philanthropists, DAOs, and individuals can all benefit from zkBob privacy features while maintaining compliance. zkBob is already in use by several projects for stable salary payments. Sample use cases include:

* Businesses who want to [pay salaries in stablecoins](employee-salary.md) without displaying amounts sent to different employees.
* Business owners who do not want to [divulge vendor addresses or prices they paid for items](vendor-purchasing.md) to reduce competitive risk.
* Philanthropists who want to donate to causes anonymously.
* Everyday users who want a "digital cash" option to transfer and trade for goods and services with one another privately through a shielded pool.
