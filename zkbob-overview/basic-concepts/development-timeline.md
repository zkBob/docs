# Development Timeline

zkBob has been in research and development since December 2020. The original concept was initiated by members of the now defunct xDai research group and the [ZeroPool](https://zeropool.network/) team. Chains with robust infrastructure led contributors to select Polygon and then Optimism for deployment.
