# Multichain Deployment

## Why Multichain?

Chains with a **mature and robust infrastructure** support the needs of the zkBob application. Useful applications include:

* Uniswap v3
* Aave
* Native USDC implementation

Polygon and Optimism both support these applications and are committed to protecting privacy and neutrality for the Ethereum ecosystem. Future governance decisions may create additional deployments in other on-chain environments in the future.
