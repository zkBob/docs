# Multichain Deployment

## Why Multichain?

Chains with a **mature and robust infrastructure** support the needs of the zkBob application. Useful applications include:

* Uniswap v3
* Aave
* Native USDC implementation

Polygon and Optimism both support these applications and are committed to protecting privacy and neutrality for the Ethereum ecosystem. zkBob is also available on Tron.

&#x20;Future governance decisions may create additional deployments in other on-chain environments in the future.
