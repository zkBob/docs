# Getting Started

To familiarize yourself with the protocol and become an early adopter and experienced zkBob supporter, follow these 10 simple tasks!

1. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zkBob\_).
2. Join our [Community Telegram](https://t.me/zkbobcommunity).
3. [Sign up for our Blog](https://blog.zkbob.com/). Get up to date info and Alpha right to your email, before it's released to the general public.
4. [Checkout our Dappback campaign](https://dappback.com/zkbob). This will get you familiar with the product and walk you through various quests to learn and interact with zkBob. You receive a special NFT for participating.
5. [Create a zkBob zkAccount](../../zkbob-app/account-creation/). Use your MetaMask or WalletConnect wallet, or create a standalone zkAccount on the zkBob deployments on Polygon or Optimism.
6. [Deposit](../../zkbob-app/deposits.md) into your account. Connect your wallet to deposit. The transaction will show the wallet that deposited to the zkBob contract, but will not include any details about your zkAccount.
7. [Transfer](../../zkbob-app/transfers/) to a friend. All transfers within the zkBob application are private, and do not show the amount or recipient to anyone other than the sender and receiver of the transaction.
8. [Withdraw ](../../zkbob-app/withdrawals/)to a new or existing address. The wallet receiving a withdrawal will show the withdrawal originated from the zkBob application, but no information about who sent it or the depositing source.
