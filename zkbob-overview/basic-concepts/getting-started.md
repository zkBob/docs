1. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zkBob\_).
2. Join our [Community Telegram](https://t.me/zkbobcommunity).
3. [Sign up for our Blog](https://blog.zkbob.com/). Get up to date info and Alpha right to your email, before it's released to the general public.
4. [Checkout our Dappback campaign](https://dappback.com/zkbob). This will get you familiar with the product and walk you through various quests to learn and interact with zkBob. You receive a special NFT for participating.
5. [Create a zkBob zkAccount](../../zkbob-app/account-creation/). Use your MetaMask or WalletConnect wallet, or create a standalone zkAccount on the zkBob deployments on Polygon or Optimism.
6. [Deposit](../../zkbob-app/deposits.md) into your account. Connect your wallet to deposit BOB. The transaction will show the wallet that deposited to the zkBob contract, but will not include any details about your zkAccount.

8. [Withdraw ](../../zkbob-app/withdrawals/)to a new or existing address. The wallet receiving a withdrawal will show the withdrawal originated from the zkBob application, but no information about who sent it or the depositing source.
