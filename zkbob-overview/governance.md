# Governance

zkBob protocol updates (along with BOB stablecoin updates) are handled via a governance [multi-sig SAFE.](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/matic:0xd4a3D9Ca00fa1fD8833D560F9217458E61c446d8/home) This process will be transitioned to a larger BOB DAO following the beta implementation.

### Protocol Governance

Updates to the protocol are managed via the governance SAFE. More info on protocol governance, decisions, and implementations is available on the BOB docs [page](https://bob-docs.zkbob.com/bob-dao/governance/protocol-governance).
